<div id="about">

My grandmother's first name is Fanny and her last name is Ben Amra.
She was born on January 14, 1945 in Morocco. Her father's name was Maimon and her mother's name was Hanna, she grew up in Morocco and at the age of 11 she came to Israel by ship through Italy and came straight to Lod.
My grandmother grew up in a school where they spoke French with a very strict education. She remembers that the teacher would beat them with her nails and give them very difficult tasks.
As a child she used to play class and it's a shame.
My grandfather and grandmother met through a joint company called Dorit, which created the first meeting between them, the rest of the meetings were held in a family setting, and after 5 months, as was customary at that time, my grandfather asked my grandmother's hand in marriage from her parents and a wedding date was immediately set.
The wedding was held at Café Rivira in Lod, where a home-cooked meal was served with lots of joy and an Arab band.
My grandmother was a seamstress and worked in a clothing store in her youth
My grandmother's hobby is cooking and she cooks a lot of traditional Moroccan dishes.

<h2 class="title"> Q&A</h2>
<section id="qa">
    <p style="color: #f433ad">1.Three main differences between web1, web2 and web3 are:</p>
    <p>Web1:a static web where websites were primarily built using HTML and were limited in their interactivity. It was used for one-way information sharing.</p>
    <p>Web2social network where users can generate web content, communicate and collaborate with each other, and the network has become more personal and dynamic. </P>
    <p>
        distributed web that aims to create a more decentralized and secure internet using blockchain technology. It is expected to enable peer-to-peer transactions, distributed applications and a new level of trust and transparency on the internet.    </p>
    <p style="color: #ff4aae">2.Example use scenario:
    </p>
    <p>Web1: If someone wants to find information about the concept of a soccer game, they have to enter the exact URL of the website.</p>
    <p>Web2: If someone searches for the term "football" on a search engine, the results will be manual and may not be filtered based on a user's preferences from the past. The search engine tags everything including photos, links, events, news, blogs, audio, video, etc. </P>
    <p>
    Web3: If someone searches for the term "football game" on a search engine, the labeling can resolve some of the ambiguity that conjunctions and synonyms produce within an analysis. The use of artificial intelligence will present the user with results that are more adapted to them based on their metadata and past search history. In addition, the search also relies on the user's location to provide more tailored results. For example, a person in the US searching for football will receive different results than a company person who searches for football.
